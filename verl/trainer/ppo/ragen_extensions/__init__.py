RAGEN Extensions for UserRL

This module provides optional extensions from the RAGEN paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.xxxxx)
including:
- Uncertainty-based Rollout Filtering (StarPO-S stabilization mechanism)
- Asymmetric Clipping (Gradient Shaping)
- KL Term Removal (Gradient Shaping)

These extensions can be enabled through configuration without modifying core training code.
