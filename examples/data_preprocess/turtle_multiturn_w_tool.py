Your goal is to uncover or imagine the full context behind the surface, revealing the twist or true meaning of the story.\n\n"

Only after providing this reasoning should you call the `interact_with_env` tool to interact with the environment. Always present your reasoning before making the tool call.\n"

Then, provide your answer story, ensuring it comprehensively reflects all the details you have guessed or uncovered. You can provide your answer at any time and multiple times.\n"
